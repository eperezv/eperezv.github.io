abstract: Interactions between plants and microorganisms are pivotal for plant growth
  and productivity. Several plant molecular mechanisms that shape these microbial
  communities have been identified. However, the importance of nitric oxide (NO) produced
  by plants for the associated microbiota remains elusive. Using Arabidopsis thaliana
  isogenic mutants overproducing NO (nox1, NO overexpression) or down-producing NO
  (i.e. nia1nia2 impaired in the expression of both nitrate reductases NR1/NIA1 and
  NR2/NIA2; the 35s::GSNOR1 line overexpressing nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR)
  and 35s::AHB1 line overexpressing haemoglobin 1 (AHB1)), we investigated how altered
  NO homeostasis affects microbial communities in the rhizosphere and in the roots,
  soil microbial activity and soil metabolites. We show that the rhizosphere microbiome
  was affected by the mutant genotypes, with the nox1 and nia1nia2 mutants causing
  opposite shifts in bacterial and fungal communities compared with the wild-type
  (WT) Col-0 in the rhizosphere and roots, respectively. These mutants also exhibited
  distinctive soil metabolite profiles than those from the other genotypes while soil
  microbial activity did not differ between the mutants and the WT Col-0. Our findings
  support our hypothesis that changes in NO production by plants can influence the
  plant microbiome composition with differential effects between fungal and bacterial
  communities.
