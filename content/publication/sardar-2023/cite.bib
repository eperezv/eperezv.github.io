 abstract = {Acinetobacter spp. and other non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (NFGNB) represent an important group of opportunistic pathogens due to their propensity for multiple, intrinsic, or acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antimicrobial resistant bacteria and their genes can spread to the environment through livestock manure. This study investigated the effects of fresh manure from dairy cows under antibiotic prophylaxis on the antibiotic resistome and AMR hosts in microcosms using pasture soil. We specifically focused on culturable Acinetobacter spp. and other NFGNB using CHROMagar Acinetobacter. We conducted two 28-days incubation experiments to simulate natural deposition of fresh manure on pasture soil and evaluated the effects on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial hosts through shotgun metagenomics. We found that manure application altered the abundance and composition of ARGs and their bacterial hosts, and that the effects depended on the soil source. Manure enriched the antibiotic resistome of bacteria only in the soil where native bacteria had a low abundance of ARGs. Our study highlights the role of native soil bacteria in modulating the consequences of manure deposition on soil and confirms the potential of culturable Acinetobacter spp. and other NFGNB to accumulate AMR in pasture soil receiving fresh manure.},
