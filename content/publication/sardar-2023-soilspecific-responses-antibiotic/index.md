abstract: Acinetobacter spp. and other non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria (NFGNB)
  represent an important group of opportunistic pathogens due to their propensity
  for multiple, intrinsic, or acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antimicrobial
  resistant bacteria and their genes can spread to the environment through livestock
  manure. This study investigated the effects of fresh manure from dairy cows under
  antibiotic prophylaxis on the antibiotic resistome and AMR hosts in microcosms using
  pasture soil. We specifically focused on culturable Acinetobacter spp. and other
  NFGNB using CHROMagar Acinetobacter. We conducted two 28-days incubation experiments
  to simulate natural deposition of fresh manure on pasture soil and evaluated the
  effects on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial hosts through shotgun
  metagenomics. We found that manure application altered the abundance and composition
  of ARGs and their bacterial hosts, and that the effects depended on the soil source.
  Manure enriched the antibiotic resistome of bacteria only in the soil where native
  bacteria had a low abundance of ARGs. Our study highlights the role of native soil
  bacteria in modulating the consequences of manure deposition on soil and confirms
  the potential of culturable Acinetobacter spp. and other NFGNB to accumulate AMR
  in pasture soil receiving fresh manure.
