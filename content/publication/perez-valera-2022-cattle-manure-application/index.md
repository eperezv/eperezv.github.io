abstract: Manure application improves soil productivity but also spreads microorganisms,
  some of which can be of clinical relevance. The ability of manure to spread common
  human pathogens has been widely studied but we lack understanding on whether it
  also disseminates opportunistic pathogens like Acinetobacter and other non-fermenting
  Gram-negative bacteria (NFGNB). We designed a microcosm experiment simulating the
  application of fresh manure to soil to analyse the effects on soil microbial communities
  (and vice versa), focusing on Acinetobacter and other NFGNB. We conducted two independent
  experiments with fresh cattle manure from a dairy farm and two pasture soils from
  different organic farms. We sampled the microcosms on days 2, 7, 14, 28 and 84,
  and characterized the microbial communities through sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons
  from i) total communities and ii) those cultured on CHROMagar Acinetobacter (i.e.,
  selective for NFGNB) after 24-h growth. Manure altered the community composition
  of soil microorganisms whereas the reverse effects were weaker, showing a transition
  to an environmentally structured community. Acinetobacter species increased their
  relative abundance in manure and soil under manure on day 2, especially in soils
  previously exposed to γ-irradiation to reduce the load of native microorganisms.
  Although manure spread most Acinetobacter phylotypes in the soil, it also stimulated
  a few from the soil that became occasionally abundant in manure. This study demonstrates
  that Acinetobacter species may dominate in soil and manure for a short time after
  deposition, and highlights their high responsiveness and competitiveness to changes
  likely associated with an increase in labile resources.
