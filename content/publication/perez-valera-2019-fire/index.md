abstract: The ecosystem functions performed by soil microbial communities can be indirectly
  altered by ecological disturbances that deeply modify abiotic factors. Fire, a widespread
  disturbance in nature, is well known to alter soil abiotic properties but we still
  ignore how these shifts are translated into changes in the structure of soil microbial
  communities and the ecosystem functions they deliver. The phylogenetic structure
  of soil bacterial communities has been shown to be a good predictor of ecosystem
  functioning, and therefore we used it as a measure linking the temporal variation
  of soil abiotic properties and ecosystem functions caused by an experimental fire
  in a Mediterranean shrubland. Fire immediately favoured a basal phylogenetic clade
  containing lineages that are able to thrive with high temperatures and to take advantage
  of the post-fire nutrient release. Later changes in the phylogenetic structure of
  the community were dominated by phyla from another basal clade that show competitive
  superiority coinciding with high levels of oxidizable carbon in soil. The phylogenetic
  structure of the bacterial community significantly explained not only microbial
  biomass, respiration and specific enzymatic activities related to C, N and P cycles
  but also the community-weighted mean number of 16S rRNA gene copies, an integrative
  proxy of several functions. While most of the ecosystem functions recovered one
  year after the fire, this was not the case of the structure of bacterial community,
  suggesting that functionally equivalent communities might be recovering the pre-disturbance
  levels of ecosystem performance.
