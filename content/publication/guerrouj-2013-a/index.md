abstract: Astragalus gombiformis is a desert symbiotic nitrogen-fixing legume of great
  nutritional value as fodder for camels and goats. However, there are no data published
  on the rhizobial bacteria that nodulate this wild legume in northern Africa. Thirty-four
  rhizobial bacteria were isolated from root nodules of A. gombifomis grown in sandy
  soils of the South-Eastern of Morocco. Twenty-five isolates were able to renodulate
  their original host and possessed a nodC gene copy. The phenotypic and genotypic
  characterizations carried out illustrated the diversity of the isolates. Phenotypic
  analysis showed that isolates used a great number of carbohydrates as sole carbon
  source. However, although they were isolated from arid sandy soils, the isolates
  do not tolerate drought stress applied in vitro. The phenotypic diversity corresponded
  mainly to the diversity in the use of some carbohydrates. The genetic analysis as
  assessed by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
  showed that the isolates clustered into 3 groups at a similarity coefficient of
  81 %. The nearly-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence from a representative strain of
  each PCR-group showed they were closely related to members of the genus Mesorhizobium
  of the family Phyllobactericeae within the Alphaproteobacteria. Sequencing of the
  housekeeping genes atpD, glnII and recA, and their concatenated phylogenetic analysis,
  showed they are closely related to Mesorhizobium camelthorni. Sequencing of the
  symbiotic nodC gene from each strain revealed they had 83.53 % identity with the
  nodC sequence of the type strain M. camelthorni CCNWXJ 40-4T.
