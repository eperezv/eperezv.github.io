abstract: Fire is an ecological disturbance that alters soil microbiomes and the functions
  they mediate in terrestrial eco­ systems. Soil microbial diversity in Mediterranean
  Basin ecosystems shows resilience to fire following the restoration of plant-soil
  feedbacks. We hypothesised that microbial functions related to organic matter decom­
  position and nutrient cycling might show similar patterns of recovery. We quantified
  the rates of microbial respiration and enzymatic activities related to C, N and
  P cycling in three 20-year fire chronosequences including 150 transects in 50 burned
  and unburned plots (no historical fire registers) in a paired experimental design.
  Microbial functions, except for the hydrolysis of N compounds, were sensitive to
  fire but recovered the levels of unburned plots in approximately 20–24 years. The
  recovery of microbial functions responded to abiotic and biotic drivers. Total soil
  nitrogen concentration was overall strong predictor of microbial functions. In addition,
  fungal phylogenetic diversity significantly explained the post-fire trajectories
  of potentially mineralizable C, while bacterial diversity was involved in the restoration
  of organic C and P hydrolysis. Our results suggest that the long-term recovery of
  soil biodiversity in Mediterranean Basin ecosystems creates resilience to restore
  essential ecosystem functions after fire.
