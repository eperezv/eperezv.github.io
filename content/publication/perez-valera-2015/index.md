abstract: Quantifying diversity with phylogeny-informed metrics helps understand the
  effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning (EF). The sign of these effects remains
  controversial because phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic identity may interactively
  influence EF. Positive relationships, traditionally attributed to complementarity
  effects, seem unimportant in natural soil bacterial communities. Negative relationships
  could be attributed to fitness differences leading to the overrepresentation of
  few productive clades, a mechanism recently invoked to assemble soil bacteria communities.
  We tested in two ecosystems contrasting in terms of environmental heterogeneity
  whether two metrics of phylogenetic community structure, a simpler measure of phylogenetic
  diversity (NRI) and a more complex metric incorporating taxonomic identity (PCPS),
  correctly predict microbially mediated EF. We show that the relationship between
  phylogenetic diversity and EF depends on the taxonomic identity of the main coexisting
  lineages. Phylogenetic diversity was negatively related to EF in soils where a marked
  fertility gradient exists and a single and productive clade (Proteobacteria) outcompete
  other clades in the most fertile plots. However, phylogenetic diversity was unrelated
  to EF in soils where the fertility gradient is less marked and Proteobacteria coexist
  with other abundant lineages. Including the taxonomic identity of bacterial lineages
  in metrics of phylogenetic community structure allows the prediction of EF in both
  ecosystems.
