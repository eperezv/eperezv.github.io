abstract: Fire alters ecosystems by changing the composition and community structure
  of soil microbes. The phylogenetic structure of a community provides clues about
  its main assembling mechanisms. While environmental filtering tends to reduce the
  community phylogenetic diversity by selecting for functionally (and hence phylogenetically)
  similar species, processes like competitive exclusion by limiting similarity tend
  to increase it by preventing the coexistence of functionally (and phylogenetically)
  similar species. We used co-occurrence networks to detect co-presence (bacteria
  that co-occur) or exclusion (bacteria that do not co-occur) links indicative of
  the ecological interactions structuring the community. We propose that inspecting
  the phylogenetic structure of co-presence or exclusion links allows to detect the
  main processes simultaneously assembling the community. We monitored a soil bacterial
  community after an experimental fire and found that fire altered its composition,
  richness and phylogenetic diversity. Both co-presence and exclusion links were more
  phylogenetically related than expected by chance. We interpret such a phylogenetic
  clustering in co-presence links as a result of environmental filtering, while that
  in exclusion links reflects competitive exclusion by limiting similarity. This suggests
  that environmental filtering and limiting similarity operate simultaneously to assemble
  soil bacterial communities, widening the traditional view that only environmental
  filtering structures bacterial communities.
