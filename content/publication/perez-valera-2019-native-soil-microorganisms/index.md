abstract: 'Bacterial genes responsible for resistance to antibiotic agents (ARG) are
  spread from livestock to soil through application of manure, threatening environmental
  and human health. We investigated the mechanisms of ARG dissemination and persistence
  to disentangle i) the influence of nutrients and microorganisms on the soil tetracycline
  (TET) resistome, and ii) the role of indigenous soil microbiota in preventing ARG
  spread. We analysed short-term (7 days) and persistent (84 days) effects of manure
  on the resistome of three antibiotic-free pasture soils. Four microcosm treatments
  were evaluated: control, mineral nutrient fertilization, and deposition of a layer
  of fresh manure onto soil or γ-irradiated soil. We quantified five TET-resistance
  genes, isolated 135 TET-resistant bacteria and sequenced both culturable TET-resistant
  and whole bacterial communities. Manure amendments, but not nutrient addition, increased
  the abundance of TET-r genes such as tet(Y). Such changes persisted with time, in
  contrast with the TET-resistant bacterial composition, which partially recovered
  after manure amendments. Manured γ-irradiated soils showed significantly lower nutrient
  content and higher TET-r gene abundance than non-irradiated soils, suggesting that
  native soil bacteria are essential for the fertilization effect of manure on soil
  as well as control the dissemination of potentially risky TET-r genes.'
