        I have worked in both **natural** and **managed ecosystems**, studying how environmental disturbances affect microbial diversity, community structure, and soil functions related to organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. 

        In my first postdoc at the **Biology Centre** (Czech Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic), I shifted my focus to managed ecosystems and other stressors, investigating how landspreading organic materials impacts soil properties and microbial communities. I specifically quantified the spread of environmentally risky bacteria and the release of **antibiotic resistance genes** into the environment.
        
        Recently, in my second postdoc at **INRAE** (France), I joined a research group specializing in the diversity and function of **nitrogen-cycling microorganisms**.
