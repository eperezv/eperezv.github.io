      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'

        I study how environmental disturbances, both **natural and managed**, shape soil microbial diversity, community structure, and ecosystem functions such as organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. 
        
        During my PhD, I investigated the effects of forest fires in Mediterranean ecosystems on soil microbial communities, including archaea, bacteria and fungi, focusing on the phylogenetic diversity and the relationship with ecosystem functioning. 
        
        In my first postdoc at the **Biology Centre** of the Czech Academy of Sciences (Chequia), I shifted to managed ecosystems and other stressors, examining how the application of organic amendments impacts soil properties and microbial communities. I specifically quantified the environmental dissemination of potentially pathogenic bacteria and the spread of **antibiotic resistance genes**.
        
        Currently, at **INRAE** in France, I work on the diversity and ecological roles of **nitrogen-cycling microorganisms**, aiming to understand their functional responses to agricultural practices.
